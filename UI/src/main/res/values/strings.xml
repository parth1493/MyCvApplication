    <string name="about_paulo">I started as a .net developer in 2012. Then in 2013 I participated in a
        "Nokia Asha" event in which they asked the participant to create and deploy two android applications.
        So, I successfully deploy two android application and that how I started my journey as android developer.
        Then I learned more about android from online courses in Mobile application development. I had an opportunity to join the
        Surya Infotech mobile team and worked there for almost 2 years as Android developer where I was able to successfully show
        what I have learned. This great opportunity allows me to increase my vision of the reality of Mobile Development.
        I am focusing on Android Development. Then in 2017 I joined "FriendNGo" and my first professional Android app was
        launched on the Play Store in March 2017. My career as Mobile Developer is evolving...."</string>
